How do I use this example???

Fire up app.js and navigate to two pages on two tabs:

1. localhost/: This is the client splash page.
2. localhost/admin: This is where you control the media distribution. The three boxes run as follows:
  a: link to media source. This can be:
    1. The HTML for embedding a Soundcloud song on your page.
    2. A direct link to an image 
    3. A link to an HTML5 YouTube video.
  b: A tag for the audio type. Can be:
    1. mp3
    2. pic
    3. video
  c: A search term so you can find the media.

On the admin page there is also a search bar where you can search for items by keywords.

You can also just click "Find Media" to find all the media you have stored in your database.

Simply click on whatever appears in the "RESULTS" div to play the media, which will show up both on the admin page and on the client page.
